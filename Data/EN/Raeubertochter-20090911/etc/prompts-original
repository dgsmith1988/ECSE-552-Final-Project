aes2 The North Wind and the Sun, attributed to Aesop, 
aes3 read for LibriVox dot org by Zonia in a German accent.
aes4 The North Wind and the Sun were disputing which was the stronger, 
aes5 when a traveler came along wrapped in a warm cloak. 
aes6 They agreed that the one who first succeeded in making the traveler take his cloak off
aes7 should be considered stronger than the other. 
aes8 Then the North Wind blew as hard as he could, 
aes9 but the more he blew the more closely did the traveler fold his cloak around him; 
aes10 and at last the North Wind gave up the attempt. 
aes11 Then the Sun shone out warmly, 
aes12 and immediately the traveler took off his cloak. 
aes13 And so the North Wind was obliged to confess 
aes14 that the Sun was the stronger of the two.

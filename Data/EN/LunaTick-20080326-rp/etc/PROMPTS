LunaTick-20080326-rp/mfc/rp-1 WHEN THE SUNLIGHT STRIKES RAINDROPS IN THE AIR
LunaTick-20080326-rp/mfc/rp-2 THEY ACT AS A PRISM AND FORM A RAINBOW
LunaTick-20080326-rp/mfc/rp-3 THE RAINBOW IS A DIVISION OF WHITE LIGHT INTO MANY BEAUTIFUL COLORS
LunaTick-20080326-rp/mfc/rp-4 THESE TAKE THE SHAPE OF A LONG ROUND ARCH WITH ITS PATH HIGH ABOVE
LunaTick-20080326-rp/mfc/rp-5 AND ITS TWO ENDS APPARENTLY BEYOND THE HORIZON
LunaTick-20080326-rp/mfc/rp-6 THERE IS  ACCORDING TO LEGEND A BOILING POT OF GOLD AT ONE END
LunaTick-20080326-rp/mfc/rp-7 PEOPLE LOOK BUT NO ONE EVER FINDS IT
LunaTick-20080326-rp/mfc/rp-8 WHEN A MAN LOOKS FOR SOMETHING BEYOND HIS REACH
LunaTick-20080326-rp/mfc/rp-9 HIS FRIENDS SAY HE IS LOOKING FOR THE POT OF GOLD AT THE END OF THE RAINBOW
LunaTick-20080326-rp/mfc/rp-10 THROUGHOUT THE CENTURIES PEOPLE HAVE EXPLAINED THE RAINBOW IN VARIOUS WAYS
LunaTick-20080326-rp/mfc/rp-11 SOME HAVE ACCEPTED IT AS A MIRACLE WITHOUT PHYSICAL EXPLANATION
LunaTick-20080326-rp/mfc/rp-12 TO THE HEBREWS IT WAS A TOKEN THAT THERE WOULD BE NO MORE UNIVERSAL FLOODS
LunaTick-20080326-rp/mfc/rp-13 THE GREEKS USED TO IMAGINE THAT IT WAS A SIGN
LunaTick-20080326-rp/mfc/rp-14 FROM THE GODS TO FORETELL WAR OR HEAVY RAIN
LunaTick-20080326-rp/mfc/rp-15 THE NORSEMEN CONSIDERED THE RAINBOW AS A BRIDGE
LunaTick-20080326-rp/mfc/rp-16 OVER WHICH THE GODS PASSED FROM EARTH TO THEIR HOME IN THE SKY
LunaTick-20080326-rp/mfc/rp-17 OTHERS HAVE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE PHENOMENON PHYSICALLY
LunaTick-20080326-rp/mfc/rp-18 ARISTOTLE THOUGHT THAT THE RAINBOW WAS CAUSED BY
LunaTick-20080326-rp/mfc/rp-19 REFLECTION OF THE SUN'S RAYS BY THE RAIN
LunaTick-20080326-rp/mfc/rp-20 SINCE THEN PHYSICISTS HAVE FOUND THAT IT IS NOT REFLECTION
LunaTick-20080326-rp/mfc/rp-21 BUT REFRACTION BY THE RAINDROPS WHICH CAUSES THE RAINBOWS
LunaTick-20080326-rp/mfc/rp-22 MANY COMPLICATED IDEAS ABOUT THE RAINBOW HAVE BEEN FORMED
LunaTick-20080326-rp/mfc/rp-23 THE DIFFERENCE IN THE RAINBOW DEPENDS CONSIDERABLY UPON THE SIZE OF THE DROPS
LunaTick-20080326-rp/mfc/rp-24 AND THE WIDTH OF THE COLORED BAND INCREASES AS THE SIZE OF THE DROPS INCREASES
LunaTick-20080326-rp/mfc/rp-25 THE ACTUAL PRIMARY RAINBOW OBSERVED IS SAID TO BE THE EFFECT OF
LunaTick-20080326-rp/mfc/rp-26 SUPER-IMPOSITION OF A NUMBER OF BOWS
LunaTick-20080326-rp/mfc/rp-27 IF THE RED OF THE SECOND BOW FALLS UPON THE GREEN OF THE FIRST
LunaTick-20080326-rp/mfc/rp-28 THE RESULT IS TO GIVE A BOW WITH AN ABNORMALLY WIDE YELLOW BAND
LunaTick-20080326-rp/mfc/rp-29 SINCE RED AND GREEN LIGHT WHEN MIXED FORM YELLOW
LunaTick-20080326-rp/mfc/rp-30 THIS IS A VERY COMMON TYPE OF BOW ONE SHOWING MAINLY RED AND YELLOW
LunaTick-20080326-rp/mfc/rp-31 WITH LITTLE OR NO GREEN OR BLUE

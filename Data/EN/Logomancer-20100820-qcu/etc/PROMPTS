Logomancer-20100820-qcu/mfc/b0288 WE WOULD NOT SPEND ANOTHER SUCH NIGHT
Logomancer-20100820-qcu/mfc/b0289 AT FIRST HIS PROGRESS WAS SLOW AND ERRATIC
Logomancer-20100820-qcu/mfc/b0290 HE PLACED HIS PAW ON ONE AND ITS MOVEMENTS WERE ACCELERATED
Logomancer-20100820-qcu/mfc/b0291 THE AWE OF MAN RUSHED OVER HIM AGAIN
Logomancer-20100820-qcu/mfc/b0292 THE FIRE-MEN WORE ANIMAL SKINS AROUND THEIR WAISTS AND ACROSS THEIR SHOULDERS
Logomancer-20100820-qcu/mfc/b0293 BETWEEN HIM AND ALL DOMESTIC ANIMALS THERE MUST BE NO HOSTILITIES
Logomancer-20100820-qcu/mfc/b0294 FOR A MUCH LONGER TIME LOP-EAR AND I REMAINED AND WATCHED
Logomancer-20100820-qcu/mfc/b0295 ALL RIGHT SIR REPLIED JOCK WITH GREAT REGRET
Logomancer-20100820-qcu/mfc/b0296 AT TIMES I WONDERED WHERE SIR ARCHIBALD GOT HIS STYLE
Logomancer-20100820-qcu/mfc/b0297 WHY SHOULD A FELLOW THROW UP THE SPONGE AFTER THE FIRST ROUND

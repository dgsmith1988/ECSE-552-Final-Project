Hyshinara-20080326-cfp/mfc/a0149 FOR AN INSTANT HE SAW PIERRE DRAWN LIKE A SILHOUETTE AGAINST THE SKY
Hyshinara-20080326-cfp/mfc/a0150 GOODBYE PIERRE HE SHOUTED
Hyshinara-20080326-cfp/mfc/a0151 AND MACDOUGALL WAS BEYOND THE TRAIL WITH THREE WEEKS TO SPARE
Hyshinara-20080326-cfp/mfc/a0152 PHILIP THRUST HIMSELF AGAINST IT AND ENTERED
Hyshinara-20080326-cfp/mfc/a0153 MACDOUGALL TAPPED HIS FOREHEAD SUSPICIOUSLY WITH A STUBBY FOREFINGER
Hyshinara-20080326-cfp/mfc/a0154 HE WAS SMOOTH-SHAVEN AND HIS HAIR AND EYES WERE BLACK
Hyshinara-20080326-cfp/mfc/a0155 WON'T YOU DRAW UP GENTLEMEN
Hyshinara-20080326-cfp/mfc/a0156 A STRANGE FIRE BURNED IN HIS EYES WHEN THORPE TURNED
Hyshinara-20080326-cfp/mfc/a0157 HE HAD WORSHIPED HER AS DANTE MIGHT HAVE WORSHIPED BEATRICE
Hyshinara-20080326-cfp/mfc/a0158 DOES THAT LOOK GOOD

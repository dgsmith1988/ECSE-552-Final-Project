John-20090617-loy/mfc/b0159 HIS TEETH SHUT WITH A LAST CLICK
John-20090617-loy/mfc/b0160 IT WAS OVER WHEN HE MADE HIS WAY THROUGH THE RING OF SPECTATORS
John-20090617-loy/mfc/b0161 IN A FLASH HE WAS ON HIS FEET FACING HIM
John-20090617-loy/mfc/b0162 HE THOUGHT HE SAW A SHUDDER PASS THROUGH THE FACTOR'S SHOULDERS
John-20090617-loy/mfc/b0163 THE MOON HAD ALREADY BEGUN ITS WESTWARD DECLINE
John-20090617-loy/mfc/b0164 THEY LAUGHED LIKE TWO HAPPY CHILDREN
John-20090617-loy/mfc/b0165 HE PULLED AND THE LOG CRASHED DOWN TO BREAK HIS BACK
John-20090617-loy/mfc/b0166 FAST BUT ENDURE
John-20090617-loy/mfc/b0167 A LITTLE BEFORE DAWN OF THE DAY FOLLOWING THE FIRE RELIEF CAME
John-20090617-loy/mfc/b0168 THE INDIAN FELT THE WORSHIP OF HER WARM IN HIS HEART

Paddy-20100120-msy/mfc/b0092 I WANT TO DIE IN IT
Paddy-20100120-msy/mfc/b0093 DARKNESS HID HIM FROM JEANNE
Paddy-20100120-msy/mfc/b0094 AND YET IF SHE CAME HE HAD NO WORDS TO SAY
Paddy-20100120-msy/mfc/b0095 HE HEARD A SOUND WHICH BROUGHT HIM QUICKLY INTO CONSCIOUSNESS OF DAY
Paddy-20100120-msy/mfc/b0096 WITHIN HIMSELF HE CALLED IT NO LONGER HIS OWN
Paddy-20100120-msy/mfc/b0097 BESIDES THAT NOISE MAKES ME DEAF
Paddy-20100120-msy/mfc/b0098 PHILIP LOOKED BACK FROM THE CREST AND SAW JEANNE LEANING OVER THE CANOE
Paddy-20100120-msy/mfc/b0099 FIFTY YARDS AHEAD OF HER WERE THE FIRST OF THE ROCKS
Paddy-20100120-msy/mfc/b0100 THERE WAS ONE CHANCE AND ONLY ONE OF SAVING JEANNE
Paddy-20100120-msy/mfc/b0101 YOU'RE A DEVIL FOR FIGHTING AND WILL SURELY WIN

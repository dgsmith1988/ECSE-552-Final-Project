LunaTick-20080329-vf2/mfc/vf2-1 MEANWHILE I'LL GO OUT TO BREATHE A SPELL
LunaTick-20080329-vf2/mfc/vf2-2 HOW COULD HE EXPLAIN HIS POSSESSION OF THE SKETCH
LunaTick-20080329-vf2/mfc/vf2-3 IT SEEMED NEARER TO HIM SINCE HE HAD SEEN AND TALKED WITH GREGSON
LunaTick-20080329-vf2/mfc/vf2-4 HER OWN BETRAYAL OF HERSELF WAS LIKE TONIC TO PHILIP
LunaTick-20080329-vf2/mfc/vf2-5 HE MOVED AWAY AS QUIETLY AS HE HAD COME
LunaTick-20080329-vf2/mfc/vf2-6 THE GIRL FACED HIM HER EYES SHINING WITH SUDDEN FEAR
LunaTick-20080329-vf2/mfc/vf2-7 CLOSE BESIDE HIM GLEAMED THE WHITE FANGS OF THE WOLF-DOG
LunaTick-20080329-vf2/mfc/vf2-8 HE LOOKED AT THE HANDKERCHIEF MORE CLOSELY
LunaTick-20080329-vf2/mfc/vf2-9 GREGSON WAS ASLEEP WHEN HE RE-ENTERED THE CABIN
LunaTick-20080329-vf2/mfc/vf2-10 IN SPITE OF THEIR ABSURDITY THE WORDS AFFECTED PHILIP CURIOUSLY
LunaTick-20080329-vf2/mfc/vf2-11 THE LACE WAS OF A DELICATE IVORY COLOR FAINTLY TINTED WITH YELLOW
LunaTick-20080329-vf2/mfc/vf2-12 IT WAS A CURIOUS COINCIDENCE
LunaTick-20080329-vf2/mfc/vf2-13 SUDDENLY HIS FINGERS CLOSED TIGHTLY OVER THE HANDKERCHIEF
LunaTick-20080329-vf2/mfc/vf2-14 THERE WAS NOTHING ON THE ROCK
LunaTick-20080329-vf2/mfc/vf2-15 PHILIP STOOD UNDECIDED HIS EARS STRAINED TO CATCH THE SLIGHTEST SOUND
LunaTick-20080329-vf2/mfc/vf2-16 PEARCE'S LITTLE EYES WERE FIXED ON HIM SHREWDLY
LunaTick-20080329-vf2/mfc/vf2-17 I HAVE NO IDEA REPLIED PHILIP
LunaTick-20080329-vf2/mfc/vf2-18 I CAME FOR INFORMATION MORE OUT OF CURIOSITY THAN ANYTHING ELSE
LunaTick-20080329-vf2/mfc/vf2-19 HIS IMMACULATE APPEARANCE WAS GONE
LunaTick-20080329-vf2/mfc/vf2-20 ANYWAY NO ONE SAW HER LIKE THAT
LunaTick-20080329-vf2/mfc/vf2-21 PHILIP SNATCHED AT THE LETTER WHICH GREGSON HELD OUT TO HIM
LunaTick-20080329-vf2/mfc/vf2-22 THE MEN STARED INTO EACH OTHER'S FACE
LunaTick-20080329-vf2/mfc/vf2-23 YES IT WAS A MAN WHO ASKED A STRANGER
LunaTick-20080329-vf2/mfc/vf2-24 THE FOURTH AND FIFTH DAYS PASSED WITHOUT ANY DEVELOPMENTS
LunaTick-20080329-vf2/mfc/vf2-25 THEY CLOSED NOW UNTIL HIS FINGERS WERE LIKE CORDS OF STEEL
LunaTick-20080329-vf2/mfc/vf2-26 HE SAW JEANNE FALTER FOR A MOMENT
LunaTick-20080329-vf2/mfc/vf2-27 SURELY I WILL EXCUSE YOU SHE CRIED
LunaTick-20080329-vf2/mfc/vf2-28 IN A FLASH PHILIP FOLLOWED ITS DIRECTION
LunaTick-20080329-vf2/mfc/vf2-29 IT WAS HIS INTENTION TO RETURN TO EILEEN AND HER FATHER
LunaTick-20080329-vf2/mfc/vf2-30 HE WOULD FIRST HUNT UP GREGSON AND BEGIN HIS WORK THERE
LunaTick-20080329-vf2/mfc/vf2-31 WHAT WAS THE OBJECT OF YOUR LITTLE SENSATION
LunaTick-20080329-vf2/mfc/vf2-32 BUT WHO WAS EILEEN'S DOUBLE
LunaTick-20080329-vf2/mfc/vf2-33 THE PROMOTER'S EYES WERE HEAVY WITH LITTLE PUFFY BAGS UNDER THEM
LunaTick-20080329-vf2/mfc/vf2-34 AND NOW DOWN THERE EILEEN WAS WAITING FOR HIM
LunaTick-20080329-vf2/mfc/vf2-35 THERE HAS BEEN A CHANGE SHE INTERRUPTED HIM
LunaTick-20080329-vf2/mfc/vf2-36 THE GRAY EYES FALTERED THE FLUSH DEEPENED
LunaTick-20080329-vf2/mfc/vf2-37 IT IS THE FIRE PARTLY SHE SAID
LunaTick-20080329-vf2/mfc/vf2-38 THEN AND AT SUPPER HE TRIED TO FATHOM HER
LunaTick-20080329-vf2/mfc/vf2-39 IT WAS A LARGE CANOE
LunaTick-20080329-vf2/mfc/vf2-40 WHAT IF JEANNE FAILED HIM

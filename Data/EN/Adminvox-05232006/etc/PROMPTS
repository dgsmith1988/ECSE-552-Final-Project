Adminvox-05232006/mfc/a0441 VIOLENT LIFE AND ATHLETIC SPORTS HAD NEVER APPEALED TO ME
Adminvox-05232006/mfc/a0442 YOU LIVE ON AN INCOME WHICH YOUR FATHER EARNED
Adminvox-05232006/mfc/a0443 HE WAS WORTH NOTHING TO THE WORLD
Adminvox-05232006/mfc/a0444 THEN YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN ALTRUISM
Adminvox-05232006/mfc/a0445 THE CREATIVE JOY I MURMURED
Adminvox-05232006/mfc/a0446 HE DELUGED ME OVERWHELMED ME WITH ARGUMENT
Adminvox-05232006/mfc/a0447 AH IT IS GROWING DARK AND DARKER
Adminvox-05232006/mfc/a0448 I WAS HUMP CABIN BOY ON THE SCHOONER GHOST
Adminvox-05232006/mfc/a0449 A SINEWY HAND DRIPPING WITH WATER WAS CLUTCHING THE RAIL
Adminvox-05232006/mfc/a0450 NO MAN ATE OF THE SEAL MEAT OR THE OIL
Adminvox-05232006/mfc/a0451 I NOTICED BLOOD SPOUTING FROM KERFOOT'S LEFT HAND
Adminvox-05232006/mfc/a0452 THREE OILERS AND A FOURTH ENGINEER WAS HIS GREETING
Adminvox-05232006/mfc/a0453 EIGHTEEN HUNDRED HE CALCULATED
Adminvox-05232006/mfc/a0454 THE SHARP VOICE OF WOLF LARSEN AROUSED ME
Adminvox-05232006/mfc/a0455 I OBEYED AND A MINUTE OR TWO LATER THEY STOOD BEFORE HIM
Adminvox-05232006/mfc/a0456 BUT IT WON'T CONTINUE SHE SAID WITH EASY CONFIDENCE
Adminvox-05232006/mfc/a0457 WHAT I SAW I COULD NOT AT FIRST BELIEVE
Adminvox-05232006/mfc/a0458 THE STOUT WOOD WAS CRUSHED LIKE AN EGGSHELL
Adminvox-05232006/mfc/a0459 THERE'S TOO MUCH OF THE SCHOOLBOY IN ME
Adminvox-05232006/mfc/a0460 I HAD FORGOTTEN THEIR EXISTENCE

AlfredStrauss-20110812-eza/mfc/a0152 PHILIP THRUST HIMSELF AGAINST IT AND ENTERED
AlfredStrauss-20110812-eza/mfc/a0153 MACDOUGALL TAPPED HIS FOREHEAD SUSPICIOUSLY WITH A STUBBY FOREFINGER
AlfredStrauss-20110812-eza/mfc/a0154 HE WAS SMOOTH-SHAVEN AND HIS HAIR AND EYES WERE BLACK
AlfredStrauss-20110812-eza/mfc/a0155 WON'T YOU DRAW UP GENTLEMEN
AlfredStrauss-20110812-eza/mfc/a0156 A STRANGE FIRE BURNED IN HIS EYES WHEN THORPE TURNED
AlfredStrauss-20110812-eza/mfc/a0157 HE HAD WORSHIPED HER AS DANTE MIGHT HAVE WORSHIPED BEATRICE
AlfredStrauss-20110812-eza/mfc/a0158 DOES THAT LOOK GOOD
AlfredStrauss-20110812-eza/mfc/a0159 THEY LOOK AS THOUGH HE HAD BEEN DRUMMING A PIANO ALL HIS LIFE

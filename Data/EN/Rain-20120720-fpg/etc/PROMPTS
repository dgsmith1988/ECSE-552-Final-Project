Rain-20120720-fpg/mfc/b0142 SOMETHING VASTLY MORE THRILLING HAD COME INTO IT NOW
Rain-20120720-fpg/mfc/b0143 IT TOOK HIM HALF AN HOUR TO REACH THE EDGE OF IT
Rain-20120720-fpg/mfc/b0144 BUT THERE WAS NO LONGER THE MOTHER YEARNING IN HIS HEART
Rain-20120720-fpg/mfc/b0145 BESIDES HAD HE NOT WHIPPED THE BIG OWL IN THE FOREST
Rain-20120720-fpg/mfc/b0146 AFTER ALL IT WAS SIMPLY A MISTAKE IN JUDGMENT
Rain-20120720-fpg/mfc/b0147 HAD IT STRUCK SQUARELY IT WOULD HAVE KILLED HIM
Rain-20120720-fpg/mfc/b0148 THE INDIAN EVEN POKED HIS STICK INTO THE THICK GROUND SPRUCE
Rain-20120720-fpg/mfc/b0149 PEBBLES AND DIRT FLEW ALONG WITH HAIR AND FUR
Rain-20120720-fpg/mfc/b0150 AND HE WAS FILLED WITH A STRANGE AND FOREBODING FEAR
Rain-20120720-fpg/mfc/b0151 IT WAS STEEL A FISHER TRAP

LunaTick-20080410-vf4/mfc/vf4-1 THEY ATE DINNER AT THE FIFTH AND RESTED FOR TWO HOURS
LunaTick-20080410-vf4/mfc/vf4-2 TWO YEARS AGO I GAVE UP CIVILIZATION FOR THIS
LunaTick-20080410-vf4/mfc/vf4-3 SHE HAD DIED FROM COLD AND STARVATION
LunaTick-20080410-vf4/mfc/vf4-4 IT WAS JEANNE SINGING SOFTLY OVER BEYOND THE ROCKS
LunaTick-20080410-vf4/mfc/vf4-5 HE WAS DETERMINED NOW TO MAINTAIN A MORE CERTAIN HOLD UPON HIMSELF
LunaTick-20080410-vf4/mfc/vf4-6 EACH DAY SHE BECAME A MORE VITAL PART OF HIM
LunaTick-20080410-vf4/mfc/vf4-7 IT WAS A TEMPTATION BUT HE RESISTED IT
LunaTick-20080410-vf4/mfc/vf4-8 THIS ONE HOPE WAS DESTROYED AS QUICKLY AS IT WAS BORN
LunaTick-20080410-vf4/mfc/vf4-9 HER FACE WAS AGAINST HIS BREAST
LunaTick-20080410-vf4/mfc/vf4-10 SHE WAS HIS NOW FOREVER
LunaTick-20080410-vf4/mfc/vf4-11 PROVIDENCE HAD DELIVERED HIM THROUGH THE MAELSTROM
LunaTick-20080410-vf4/mfc/vf4-12 A CRY OF JOY BURST FROM PHILIP'S LIPS
LunaTick-20080410-vf4/mfc/vf4-13 PHILIP BEGAN TO FEEL THAT HE HAD FOOLISHLY OVERESTIMATED HIS STRENGTH
LunaTick-20080410-vf4/mfc/vf4-14 HE OBEYED THE PRESSURE OF HER HAND
LunaTick-20080410-vf4/mfc/vf4-15 I AM GOING TO SURPRISE FATHER AND YOU WILL GO WITH PIERRE
LunaTick-20080410-vf4/mfc/vf4-16 ABOUT HIM EVERYWHERE WERE THE EVIDENCES OF LUXURY AND OF AGE
LunaTick-20080410-vf4/mfc/vf4-17 THEN HE STEPPED BACK WITH A LOW CRY OF PLEASURE
LunaTick-20080410-vf4/mfc/vf4-18 IN THE PICTURE HE SAW EACH MOMENT A GREATER RESEMBLANCE TO JEANNE
LunaTick-20080410-vf4/mfc/vf4-19 HE TOLD HIMSELF THAT AS HE WASHED HIMSELF AND GROOMED HIS DISHEVELED CLOTHES
LunaTick-20080410-vf4/mfc/vf4-20 ACCEPT A FATHER'S BLESSING AND WITH IT THIS
LunaTick-20080410-vf4/mfc/vf4-21 IT SEEMS LIKE A STRANGE POINTING OF THE HAND OF GOD
LunaTick-20080410-vf4/mfc/vf4-22 SUCH THINGS HAD OCCURRED BEFORE HE TOLD PHILIP
LunaTick-20080410-vf4/mfc/vf4-23 AH I HAD FORGOTTEN HE EXCLAIMED
LunaTick-20080410-vf4/mfc/vf4-24 BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING EVEN MORE STARTLING THAN THIS RESEMBLANCE
LunaTick-20080410-vf4/mfc/vf4-25 I HAVE TO BE CAREFUL OF THEM AS THEY TEAR VERY EASILY
LunaTick-20080410-vf4/mfc/vf4-26 OF COURSE THAT IS UNINTERESTING SHE CONTINUED
LunaTick-20080410-vf4/mfc/vf4-27 A MOMENT BEFORE HE WAS INTOXICATED BY A JOY THAT WAS ALMOST MADNESS
LunaTick-20080410-vf4/mfc/vf4-28 NOW THESE THINGS HAD BEEN STRUCK DEAD WITHIN HIM
LunaTick-20080410-vf4/mfc/vf4-29 FOR AN INSTANT HE SAW PIERRE DRAWN LIKE A SILHOUETTE AGAINST THE SKY
LunaTick-20080410-vf4/mfc/vf4-30 GOODBYE PIERRE HE SHOUTED
LunaTick-20080410-vf4/mfc/vf4-31 AND MACDOUGALL WAS BEYOND THE TRAIL WITH THREE WEEKS TO SPARE
LunaTick-20080410-vf4/mfc/vf4-32 PHILIP THRUST HIMSELF AGAINST IT AND ENTERED
LunaTick-20080410-vf4/mfc/vf4-33 MACDOUGALL TAPPED HIS FOREHEAD SUSPICIOUSLY WITH A STUBBY FOREFINGER
LunaTick-20080410-vf4/mfc/vf4-34 HE WAS SMOOTH-SHAVEN AND HIS HAIR AND EYES WERE BLACK
LunaTick-20080410-vf4/mfc/vf4-35 WON'T YOU DRAW UP GENTLEMEN
LunaTick-20080410-vf4/mfc/vf4-36 A STRANGE FIRE BURNED IN HIS EYES WHEN THORPE TURNED
LunaTick-20080410-vf4/mfc/vf4-37 HE HAD WORSHIPED HER AS DANTE MIGHT HAVE WORSHIPED BEATRICE
LunaTick-20080410-vf4/mfc/vf4-38 DOES THAT LOOK GOOD
LunaTick-20080410-vf4/mfc/vf4-39 THEY LOOK AS THOUGH HE HAD BEEN DRUMMING A PIANO ALL HIS LIFE
LunaTick-20080410-vf4/mfc/vf4-40 YOU WANT TO GO OVER AND SEE HIS GANG THROW DIRT

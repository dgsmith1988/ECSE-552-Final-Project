LunaTick-20080410-vf5/mfc/vf5-8 LOW BUSH WHIPPED HIM IN THE FACE AND LEFT NO STING
LunaTick-20080410-vf5/mfc/vf5-9 SUDDENLY JEANNE STOPPED FOR AN INSTANT
LunaTick-20080410-vf5/mfc/vf5-10 THERE WAS NONE OF THE JOY OF MEETING IN HIS FACE
LunaTick-20080410-vf5/mfc/vf5-11 AND WHEN YOU COME BACK IN A FEW DAYS BRING EILEEN
LunaTick-20080410-vf5/mfc/vf5-12 GREGSON HAD LEFT THE OUTER DOOR SLIGHTLY AJAR
LunaTick-20080410-vf5/mfc/vf5-13 THE DATE WAS NEARLY EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD

LunaTick-20080410-vf5/mfc/vf5-15 DOWN THERE THE EARTH WAS ALREADY SWELLING WITH LIFE
LunaTick-20080410-vf5/mfc/vf5-16 FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE HE WAS YEARNING FOR A SCRAP
LunaTick-20080410-vf5/mfc/vf5-17 SHE HAD BEEN THOROUGHLY AND EFFICIENTLY MAULED
LunaTick-20080410-vf5/mfc/vf5-18 EVERY BONE IN HER AGED BODY SEEMED BROKEN OR DISLOCATED
LunaTick-20080410-vf5/mfc/vf5-19 TOMORROW I'M GOING AFTER THAT BEAR HE SAID

LunaTick-20080410-vf5/mfc/vf5-21 SO CHEER UP AND GIVE US YOUR PAW
LunaTick-20080410-vf5/mfc/vf5-22 THIS TIME HE DID NOT YAP FOR MERCY

LunaTick-20080410-vf5/mfc/vf5-24 DON'T YOU SEE I'M CHEWING THIS THING IN TWO
LunaTick-20080410-vf5/mfc/vf5-25 THE QUESTIONS MAY HAVE COME VAGUELY IN HIS MIND
LunaTick-20080410-vf5/mfc/vf5-26 LIKE A FLASH HE LAUNCHED HIMSELF INTO THE FEATHERED MASS OF THE OWL
LunaTick-20080410-vf5/mfc/vf5-27 AHEAD OF THEM THEY SAW A GLIMMER OF SUNSHINE
LunaTick-20080410-vf5/mfc/vf5-28 TWO GIGANTIC OWLS WERE TEARING AT THE CARCASS
LunaTick-20080410-vf5/mfc/vf5-29 THE BIG-EYED CLUCKING MOOSE-BIRDS WERE MOST ANNOYING
LunaTick-20080410-vf5/mfc/vf5-30 NEXT TO THEM THE CANADA JAYS WERE MOST PERSISTENT
LunaTick-20080410-vf5/mfc/vf5-31 FOR A TIME THE EXCITING THRILL OF HIS ADVENTURE WAS GONE
LunaTick-20080410-vf5/mfc/vf5-32 HE DID NOT RUSH IN
LunaTick-20080410-vf5/mfc/vf5-33 IT WAS EDGED WITH ICE
LunaTick-20080410-vf5/mfc/vf5-34 HE DRANK OF THE WATER CAUTIOUSLY
LunaTick-20080410-vf5/mfc/vf5-35 BUT A STRANGE THING HAPPENED
LunaTick-20080410-vf5/mfc/vf5-36 HE BEGAN TO FOLLOW THE FOOTPRINTS OF THE DOG
LunaTick-20080410-vf5/mfc/vf5-37 SUCH A DOG THE WISE DRIVER KILLS OR TURNS LOOSE
LunaTick-20080410-vf5/mfc/vf5-38 SOMETIMES HER DREAMS WERE FILLED WITH VISIONS
LunaTick-20080410-vf5/mfc/vf5-39 THUS HAD THE RAW WILDERNESS PREPARED HIM FOR THIS DAY

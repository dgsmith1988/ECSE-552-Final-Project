Everett-20130514-hkp/mfc/a0147 A MOMENT BEFORE HE WAS INTOXICATED BY A JOY THAT WAS ALMOST MADNESS
Everett-20130514-hkp/mfc/a0148 NOW THESE THINGS HAD BEEN STRUCK DEAD WITHIN HIM
Everett-20130514-hkp/mfc/a0149 FOR AN INSTANT HE SAW PIERRE DRAWN LIKE A SILHOUETTE AGAINST THE SKY
Everett-20130514-hkp/mfc/a0150 GOODBYE PIERRE HE SHOUTED
Everett-20130514-hkp/mfc/a0151 AND MACDOUGALL WAS BEYOND THE TRAIL WITH THREE WEEKS TO SPARE
Everett-20130514-hkp/mfc/a0152 PHILIP THRUST HIMSELF AGAINST IT AND ENTERED
Everett-20130514-hkp/mfc/a0153 MACDOUGALL TAPPED HIS FOREHEAD SUSPICIOUSLY WITH A STUBBY FOREFINGER
Everett-20130514-hkp/mfc/a0154 HE WAS SMOOTH-SHAVEN AND HIS HAIR AND EYES WERE BLACK
Everett-20130514-hkp/mfc/a0155 WON'T YOU DRAW UP GENTLEMEN
Everett-20130514-hkp/mfc/a0156 A STRANGE FIRE BURNED IN HIS EYES WHEN THORPE TURNED

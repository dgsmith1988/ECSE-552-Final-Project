Gerry-20111231-kfv/mfc/a0161 TAKE AWAY THEIR FOREMAN AND THEY WOULDN'T BE WORTH THEIR GRUB
Gerry-20111231-kfv/mfc/a0162 THAT'S THE SUB-FOREMAN EXPLAINED THORPE
Gerry-20111231-kfv/mfc/a0163 PHILIP MADE NO EFFORT TO FOLLOW
Gerry-20111231-kfv/mfc/a0164 HE CAME FIRST A YEAR AGO AND REVEALED HIMSELF TO JEANNE
Gerry-20111231-kfv/mfc/a0165 THEY ARE TO ATTACK YOUR CAMP TOMORROW NIGHT
Gerry-20111231-kfv/mfc/a0166 TWO DAYS AGO JEANNE LEARNED WHERE HER FATHER'S MEN WERE HIDING
Gerry-20111231-kfv/mfc/a0167 I WAS NEAR THE CABIN AND SAW YOU
Gerry-20111231-kfv/mfc/a0168 LOW BUSH WHIPPED HIM IN THE FACE AND LEFT NO STING
Gerry-20111231-kfv/mfc/a0169 SUDDENLY JEANNE STOPPED FOR AN INSTANT
Gerry-20111231-kfv/mfc/a0170 THERE WAS NONE OF THE JOY OF MEETING IN HIS FACE

vf3-1 What if she did not come to the rock
vf3-2 His face was streaming with blood
vf3-3 A shadow was creeping over Pierre's eyes
vf3-4 Scarcely had he uttered the name when Pierre's closing eyes shot open
vf3-5 A trickle of fresh blood ran over his face
vf3-6 Death had come with terrible suddenness
vf3-7 Philip bent lower, and stared into the face of the dead man
vf3-8 He made sure that the magazine was loaded, and resumed his paddling
vf3-9 The nightglow was treacherous to shoot by
vf3-10 The singing voice approached rapidly
vf3-11 His blood grew hot with rage at the thought
vf3-12 He went down in midstream, searching the shadows of both shores
vf3-13 For a full minute he crouched and listened
vf3-14 He had barely entered this when he saw the glow of a fire
vf3-15 A big canvas tent was the first thing to come within his vision
vf3-16 Perhaps she had already met her fate a little deeper in the forest
vf3-17 Then you can arrange yourself comfortably among these robes in the bow
vf3-18 Shall I carry you
vf3-19 A maddening joy pounded in his brain
vf3-20 You must sleep, he urged
vf3-21 You, you would not keep the truth from me
vf3-22 He will follow us soon
vf3-23 But there came no promise from the bow of the canoe
vf3-24 She was sleeping under his protection as sweetly as a child
vf3-25 Only, it is so wonderful, so almost impossible to believe
vf3-26 The emotion which she had suppressed burst forth now in a choking sob
vf3-27 If you only could know how I thank you
vf3-28 He waded into the edge of the water and began scrubbing himself
vf3-29 Do you know that you are shaking my confidence in you
vf3-30 Much, replied Jeanne, as tersely
vf3-31 Instead, he joined her; and they ate like two hungry children
vf3-32 He was wounded in the arm
vf3-33 I suppose you picked that lingo up among the Indians
vf3-34 Her words sent a strange chill through Philip
vf3-35 He had no excuse for the feelings which were aroused in him
vf3-36 Was it the rendezvous of those who were striving to work his ruin
vf3-37 She added, with genuine sympathy in her face and voice
vf3-38 Pierre obeys me when we are together
vf3-39 Jeanne was turning the bow shoreward
vf3-40 My right foot feels like that of a Chinese debutante

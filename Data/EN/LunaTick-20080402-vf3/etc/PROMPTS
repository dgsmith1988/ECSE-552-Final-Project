LunaTick-20080402-vf3/mfc/vf3-1 WHAT IF SHE DID NOT COME TO THE ROCK
LunaTick-20080402-vf3/mfc/vf3-2 HIS FACE WAS STREAMING WITH BLOOD
LunaTick-20080402-vf3/mfc/vf3-3 A SHADOW WAS CREEPING OVER PIERRE'S EYES
LunaTick-20080402-vf3/mfc/vf3-4 SCARCELY HAD HE UTTERED THE NAME WHEN PIERRE'S CLOSING EYES SHOT OPEN
LunaTick-20080402-vf3/mfc/vf3-5 A TRICKLE OF FRESH BLOOD RAN OVER HIS FACE
LunaTick-20080402-vf3/mfc/vf3-6 DEATH HAD COME WITH TERRIBLE SUDDENNESS
LunaTick-20080402-vf3/mfc/vf3-7 PHILIP BENT LOWER AND STARED INTO THE FACE OF THE DEAD MAN
LunaTick-20080402-vf3/mfc/vf3-8 HE MADE SURE THAT THE MAGAZINE WAS LOADED AND RESUMED HIS PADDLING
LunaTick-20080402-vf3/mfc/vf3-9 THE NIGHTGLOW WAS TREACHEROUS TO SHOOT BY
LunaTick-20080402-vf3/mfc/vf3-10 THE SINGING VOICE APPROACHED RAPIDLY
LunaTick-20080402-vf3/mfc/vf3-11 HIS BLOOD GREW HOT WITH RAGE AT THE THOUGHT
LunaTick-20080402-vf3/mfc/vf3-12 HE WENT DOWN IN MIDSTREAM SEARCHING THE SHADOWS OF BOTH SHORES
LunaTick-20080402-vf3/mfc/vf3-13 FOR A FULL MINUTE HE CROUCHED AND LISTENED
LunaTick-20080402-vf3/mfc/vf3-14 HE HAD BARELY ENTERED THIS WHEN HE SAW THE GLOW OF A FIRE
LunaTick-20080402-vf3/mfc/vf3-15 A BIG CANVAS TENT WAS THE FIRST THING TO COME WITHIN HIS VISION
LunaTick-20080402-vf3/mfc/vf3-16 PERHAPS SHE HAD ALREADY MET HER FATE A LITTLE DEEPER IN THE FOREST
LunaTick-20080402-vf3/mfc/vf3-17 THEN YOU CAN ARRANGE YOURSELF COMFORTABLY AMONG THESE ROBES IN THE BOW
LunaTick-20080402-vf3/mfc/vf3-18 SHALL I CARRY YOU
LunaTick-20080402-vf3/mfc/vf3-19 A MADDENING JOY POUNDED IN HIS BRAIN
LunaTick-20080402-vf3/mfc/vf3-20 YOU MUST SLEEP HE URGED
LunaTick-20080402-vf3/mfc/vf3-21 YOU YOU WOULD NOT KEEP THE TRUTH FROM ME
LunaTick-20080402-vf3/mfc/vf3-22 HE WILL FOLLOW US SOON
LunaTick-20080402-vf3/mfc/vf3-23 BUT THERE CAME NO PROMISE FROM THE BOW OF THE CANOE
LunaTick-20080402-vf3/mfc/vf3-24 SHE WAS SLEEPING UNDER HIS PROTECTION AS SWEETLY AS A CHILD
LunaTick-20080402-vf3/mfc/vf3-25 ONLY IT IS SO WONDERFUL SO ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO BELIEVE
LunaTick-20080402-vf3/mfc/vf3-26 THE EMOTION WHICH SHE HAD SUPPRESSED BURST FORTH NOW IN A CHOKING SOB
LunaTick-20080402-vf3/mfc/vf3-27 IF YOU ONLY COULD KNOW HOW I THANK YOU
LunaTick-20080402-vf3/mfc/vf3-28 HE WADED INTO THE EDGE OF THE WATER AND BEGAN SCRUBBING HIMSELF
LunaTick-20080402-vf3/mfc/vf3-29 DO YOU KNOW THAT YOU ARE SHAKING MY CONFIDENCE IN YOU
LunaTick-20080402-vf3/mfc/vf3-30 MUCH REPLIED JEANNE AS TERSELY
LunaTick-20080402-vf3/mfc/vf3-31 INSTEAD HE JOINED HER AND THEY ATE LIKE TWO HUNGRY CHILDREN
LunaTick-20080402-vf3/mfc/vf3-32 HE WAS WOUNDED IN THE ARM
LunaTick-20080402-vf3/mfc/vf3-33 I SUPPOSE YOU PICKED THAT LINGO UP AMONG THE INDIANS
LunaTick-20080402-vf3/mfc/vf3-34 HER WORDS SENT A STRANGE CHILL THROUGH PHILIP
LunaTick-20080402-vf3/mfc/vf3-35 HE HAD NO EXCUSE FOR THE FEELINGS WHICH WERE AROUSED IN HIM
LunaTick-20080402-vf3/mfc/vf3-36 WAS IT THE RENDEZVOUS OF THOSE WHO WERE STRIVING TO WORK HIS RUIN
LunaTick-20080402-vf3/mfc/vf3-37 SHE ADDED WITH GENUINE SYMPATHY IN HER FACE AND VOICE
LunaTick-20080402-vf3/mfc/vf3-38 PIERRE OBEYS ME WHEN WE ARE TOGETHER
LunaTick-20080402-vf3/mfc/vf3-39 JEANNE WAS TURNING THE BOW SHOREWARD
LunaTick-20080402-vf3/mfc/vf3-40 MY RIGHT FOOT FEELS LIKE THAT OF A CHINESE DEBUTANTE

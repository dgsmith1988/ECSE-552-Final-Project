ESimpray-20150123-qlg/mfc/a0090 THE SINGING VOICE APPROACHED RAPIDLY
ESimpray-20150123-qlg/mfc/a0091 HIS BLOOD GREW HOT WITH RAGE AT THE THOUGHT
ESimpray-20150123-qlg/mfc/a0092 HE WENT DOWN IN MIDSTREAM SEARCHING THE SHADOWS OF BOTH SHORES
ESimpray-20150123-qlg/mfc/a0093 FOR A FULL MINUTE HE CROUCHED AND LISTENED
ESimpray-20150123-qlg/mfc/a0094 HE HAD BARELY ENTERED THIS WHEN HE SAW THE GLOW OF A FIRE
ESimpray-20150123-qlg/mfc/a0095 A BIG CANVAS TENT WAS THE FIRST THING TO COME WITHIN HIS VISION
ESimpray-20150123-qlg/mfc/a0096 PERHAPS SHE HAD ALREADY MET HER FATE A LITTLE DEEPER IN THE FOREST
ESimpray-20150123-qlg/mfc/a0097 THEN YOU CAN ARRANGE YOURSELF COMFORTABLY AMONG THESE ROBES IN THE BOW
ESimpray-20150123-qlg/mfc/a0098 SHALL I CARRY YOU
ESimpray-20150123-qlg/mfc/a0099 A MADDENING JOY POUNDED IN HIS BRAIN

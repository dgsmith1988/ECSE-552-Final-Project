Madfrenchie-20101015-tue/mfc/b0094 AND YET IF SHE CAME HE HAD NO WORDS TO SAY
Madfrenchie-20101015-tue/mfc/b0095 HE HEARD A SOUND WHICH BROUGHT HIM QUICKLY INTO CONSCIOUSNESS OF DAY
Madfrenchie-20101015-tue/mfc/b0096 WITHIN HIMSELF HE CALLED IT NO LONGER HIS OWN
Madfrenchie-20101015-tue/mfc/b0097 BESIDES THAT NOISE MAKES ME DEAF
Madfrenchie-20101015-tue/mfc/b0098 PHILIP LOOKED BACK FROM THE CREST AND SAW JEANNE LEANING OVER THE CANOE
Madfrenchie-20101015-tue/mfc/b0099 FIFTY YARDS AHEAD OF HER WERE THE FIRST OF THE ROCKS
Madfrenchie-20101015-tue/mfc/b0100 THERE WAS ONE CHANCE AND ONLY ONE OF SAVING JEANNE
Madfrenchie-20101015-tue/mfc/b0101 YOU'RE A DEVIL FOR FIGHTING AND WILL SURELY WIN
Madfrenchie-20101015-tue/mfc/b0102 I'LL ONLY BE IN THE WAY
Madfrenchie-20101015-tue/mfc/b0103 HE LIFTED HIS EYES AND A STRANGE CRY BURST FROM HIS LIPS
